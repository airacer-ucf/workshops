  [https://www.techspot.com/downloads/2755-vmware-fusion-mac.html](https://www.techspot.com/downloads/2755-vmware-fusion-mac.html)
  * From the download options, click on a version, and the download should start automatically (This tutorial is tested on the `25H2` version, but feel free to try a newer version if available)

**Install steps:**

1. Open the downloaded `.dmg`
2. Double click **VMware Fusion** or drag it to **Applications** (depends on installer)
3. Launch VMware Fusion if not automatically launched
4. Approve permissions in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**

## Step 2: Download Ubuntu 22.04 (Critical Differences)

### Windows & macOS Intel

Download **Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop (amd64)**:
[https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/)

On the `Desktop image` section, click on `64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop image`, and the download should start automatically

File name example:

```
ubuntu-22.04.x-desktop-amd64.iso
```

This is the **official Ubuntu Desktop ISO**.

---

### macOS Apple Silicon Chips

> **Important:** Ubuntu does **not** provide an official Desktop ARM ISO.

Instead, download **Ubuntu 22.04 Server (ARM)**:
[https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/jammy/release/](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/jammy/release/)

On the `Server install image` section, click on `64-bit ARM (ARMv8/AArch64) server install image`, and the download should start automatically

File name example:

```
ubuntu-22.04.x-live-server-arm64.iso
```

> You will install the **desktop later**.

## Step 3: Create the Virtual Machine

### Windows (VMware Workstation Pro)

1. Open **VMware Workstation Pro**
2. Click **Create a New Virtual Machine**
3. Select **Installer disc image file (iso)**
4. Browse to the Ubuntu ISO file you downloaded earlier
5. Click **Next**
6. Follow the recommended setting options
7. Name the VM (e.g., `Ubuntu 22.04`)
8. Disk size:

   * Recommended: **50 GB**
9. Click **Finish**

---

### macOS (VMware Fusion – Intel & Apple Silicon)

1. Open **VMware Fusion Pro**
2. Click **Create New** if prompted
3. Select **Install from disc or image** then press `Continue`
4. Drag the Ubuntu ISO file recently downloaded or click on `Use another disc or disc image...` to choose the Ubuntu ISO file downloaded
5. Click **Continue**
6. Follow the recommended setting options (Disk size: 50 GB)
7. Finish setup

## Step 6: Install VMware Tools (All Platforms)

VMware Tools improves:

* Display resolution
* Mouse integration
* Performance

### Inside the Ubuntu VM

In Ubuntu, open a terminal (go on apps and look for `Terminal` and run:

## Notes

* Installing Ubuntu in a VM **does not affect your real operating system**
* Apple Silicon Macs require **ARM-based Linux**
* Using Ubuntu Server + desktop is **fully supported and standard practice**

## Verify Ubuntu Version

Open a terminal in your Ubuntu 22 environment and run:

```bash
lsb_release -a
```
You should see information about which Ubuntu version you have installed
